                <p>For Modules 2 and, 3 we covered Web Development including HTML, CSS, Javascript and Webhosting.<br>
		<Br>For project #3, we had to creat a drag and drop quiz. I decided to base mine on sports and sports terminology. Please find my activity here: <b><a href="https://livehardy.github.io/draganddrop/">Drag and Drop Activity</a></b> <br>			
My initial changes were to the font type and background color. Using a simple Google search I was able to locate the fonts and colors available for HTML. Trebuchet MS was coded as the primary font and Tahoma was set as a back up. The background color was changed to Light Teal (#B3D9D9) and the main text was made Black (#000000) text to provide a better contrast for accessibility. The header background colors were changed to Dark Teal (#317082) and the header font was made White (#FFFFFF), again, for contrast. The background of the movable items was changed to gray (#C0C0C0) to match the borders of the main container, drag container and drop containers. I made all of these borders wider (5px) to create a more divided appearance and adjusted their width and/or height to fit the new list of terms and drop containers more precisely. I adjusted the instructions, breaking them into two separate lines and then made any priority text bold and red (#6F4545) for increased visibility. I adjusted the code to allow 6 items per each of the drop boxes. Lastly, I changed the cursor to a "grab" icon. I uploaded the files incorrectly at first, but after some readjusting I was able to get it working. Github is my site of choice - it's the most user friendly in my opinion! I am excited about the material we covered and how it can be applied immediately. I feel more confident in my understanding of html, JavaScript and CSS now. I agree with some of my peers that this assignment was a bit easier to navigate.
		<br>
		<br>
		For project #4, we created javascript quizzes. I decided to base mine on halloween. Please find my quiz here:<b> <a href="https://livehardy.github.io/halloweenquiz/">Halloween Quiz!</a> </b><br>
			
I had no issues following along with the JavaScript Kit and the "HTML & JavaScript" tutorial to customize the code in my HTML and JavaScript quiz. I made some adjustments to go with my Halloween theme, including the following:

Despite following the Web Hosting and Uploading Files tutorial exactly, I struggled to get a working domain link even after I purchased web hosting and uploaded the files. Like one of my other classmates, a notification appeared on my primary domain, indicating error #1: DEPTH_ZERO_SELF_SIGNED_CERT. I spoke with their customer service and was told I needed to purchase the domain as well - $30+ later, the link still does not appear to work properly. I also attempted to go through id.000webhost.com per my peers advice. I followed the steps of placing my coding files directly into the "public_html" directory, but again was met with errors. I spent hours reading through these comments and searching youtube/google, but nothing proved helpful.

This project was beneficial, but equally frustrating. I kept my code changes limited to the video and followed the instructions exactly, but was still unsuccessful on making my quiz public through several sites. <b>I was finally able to get it working through Github. </b>
