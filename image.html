			<b>Book Cover</b><br>
<img src="Gather Round (1).jpg" alt="book" /><br>
We had to create book covers for this module. I used Canva for my book cover creation and I found it to be quite user friendly. I love the ease with which you could customize. The inspiration for my book cover comes from my love of cooking and the arrival of Fall in Florida. The weather had been so lovely lately, allowing my sons and I to explore some of the local pumpkin festivals. As a result, you will see elements of a fall theme incorporated into the book cover as well as a few unique touches I thought would make it more my personal style. I chose pumpkins as the background because they are on theme and universally recognized as a symbol for Halloween or fall. I maxed out the highlight and further reduced the shadow to make the colors pop a little brighter and the shadows to be a litter darker. I went for the orange ripped paper banner because it looks rustic and matched it similarly to the tone of the focus pumpkin. I wanted to add some lace/burlap as well because it is something that reminds me of my family table and memories spent in the kitchen together. Making the layers slightly transparent helped give the illusion of a real tablecloth setting. For a combination of bold and welcoming fonts I opted for Lovelo and Moontime.

<b>Logo</b><br>
<img src="Smith & Sons Trucking.jpg" alt="book" /><br>
We had to create logos for this module. I used Canva for my logo creation as well. The logo I chose to do, Kacey & Sons Trucking, is for my husband’s aspiring trucking company. Truck driving has been a generational tradition in his family and is something he hopes to continue with our sons too. Main influences for the logo come from my husband’s personality and what I feel he would enjoy. From what I’ve seen, logos for trucking companies are forgettable so I wanted to make something to stand out. The color choice was simple, a classic black and white contrast – simple and clean, but it still looks modern and catches the eye. I wanted something different, but neon or something too extreme doesn’t seem congruent to this field of work or my vision. I manipulated the letter spacing to create a half circle shape around the focus image. The focus image I selected is a semi-trailer centered in the middle of the logo name. My font choice was Bicubik, which is an all-caps font that looks bold and classic but also futuristic. After playing around with some effects I really liked how the hollow effect added to the overall look.</p>
