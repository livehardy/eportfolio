                <p>I created my educational video using Movie Maker - Video Editor Pro. I wanted to use a familiar but fairly simple topic for my video, so I opted on color theory and the color wheel. I started by locating the images I wanted to use - all found through the links provided. Next, I wrote a script. Once these two steps were completed, I added the transitions, special effects and text for each photo. I adjusted the speed to fit everything I wanted to say within the allotted times. I chose flyeye for my transition effect and some assorted motion options. I was able to add my voiceovers and audio easily through the Movie Maker app. I added the background sound "colorful sky" to stay on theme with the color story. I set the song volume low so it would not overpower my voice. I played the video several times to make sure everything was to my liking. I am proud of my outcome overall and learned a lot about the movie maker app in the process.</p>
